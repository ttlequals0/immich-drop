# Immich Drop Uploader

A tiny web app for collecting photos/videos into your **Immich** server.
Admin users log in to create public invite links; invite links are always public-by-URL. A public uploader page is optional and disabled by default.

- **Duplicate Prevention:** local SHA‑1 cache (+ optional Immich bulk-check)
- **Progress Queue:** WebSocket updates; retry failed items
- **Chunked Uploads (optional):** large-file support with configurable chunk size
- **Privacy-first:** never lists server media; session-local uploads only
- **Mobile + Dark Mode:** responsive UI, safe-area padding, persistent theme
- **URL Downloads:** download from TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter and upload to Immich
- **Platform Cookies:** add authentication cookies for platforms requiring login (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)

## Quick start
You can run without a `.env` file by putting all settings in `docker-compose.yml` (recommended for deploys).
Use a `.env` file only for local development.

### docker-compose.yml (deploy without .env)
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  immich-drop:
    image: ghcr.io/nasogaa/immich-drop:latest
    pull_policy: always
    container_name: immich-drop
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Configure all settings here (no .env required)
    environment:

      # Immich connection (must include /api)
      IMMICH_BASE_URL: https://immich.example.com/api
      IMMICH_API_KEY: ${IMMICH_API_KEY}

      # Optional behavior
      IMMICH_ALBUM_NAME: dead-drop
      PUBLIC_UPLOAD_PAGE_ENABLED: "false"   # keep disabled by default
      PUBLIC_BASE_URL: https://drop.example.com

      # Large files: chunked uploads (bypass 100MB proxy limits)
      CHUNKED_UPLOADS_ENABLED: "false"      # enable chunked uploads
      CHUNK_SIZE_MB: "95"                  # per-chunk size (MB)

      # App internals
      SESSION_SECRET: ${SESSION_SECRET}

    # Expose the app on the host
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

    # Persist local dedupe cache (state.db) across restarts
    volumes:
      - immich_drop_data:/data

    # Simple healthcheck
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "python - <<'PY'\nimport os,urllib.request,sys; url=f\"http://127.0.0.1:{os.getenv('PORT','8080')}/\";\ntry: urllib.request.urlopen(url, timeout=3); sys.exit(0)\nexcept Exception: sys.exit(1)\nPY"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s

volumes:
  immich_drop_data:
```

```
### CLI
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## iOS Shortcuts

Share photos, videos, and social media links directly from your iPhone to Immich.

**Features:**
- Single shortcut handles both files AND URLs (TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter)
- Upload multiple photos/videos at once
- Shows upload progress notifications

**[View Setup Guide](docs/ios-shortcuts.md)**

---

## URL Downloads

Upload content from social media platforms directly via the web UI or API:

**Supported Platforms:**
- TikTok
- Instagram (Reels, Posts)
- Reddit (videos, images)
- YouTube (Shorts, videos)
- Twitter/X

**API Endpoints:**
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/upload/base64` | POST | Upload base64-encoded file (best for iOS Shortcuts) |
| `/api/upload/url` | POST | Download and upload from single URL |
| `/api/upload/urls` | POST | Batch URL downloads (max 10) |
| `/api/supported-platforms` | GET | List supported platforms |

---

## Platform Cookies

Many social media platforms require authentication to access certain content (e.g., Instagram Reels, private TikTok videos). You can configure cookies in the admin panel to enable authenticated downloads.

**Setup:**
1. Log in to the admin menu (`/menu`)
2. Scroll to "Platform Cookies" section
3. Select platform (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube)
4. Paste your cookie string from browser DevTools
5. Click "Save Cookie"

**Getting cookies from your browser:**
1. Open the platform in your browser (logged in)
2. Open DevTools (F12) > Network tab
3. Refresh the page and click any request to the platform
4. Find "Cookie:" in Request Headers
5. Copy the entire value

**Cookie API Endpoints:**
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/cookies` | GET | List configured platform cookies |
| `/api/cookies` | POST | Create or update platform cookie |
| `/api/cookies/{platform}` | DELETE | Delete platform cookie |

Cookies are stored server-side in `/data/cookies/` and automatically used when downloading from the corresponding platform.

## What's New

### v0.5.0 – Manage Links overhaul
- In-panel bulk actions footer (Delete/Enable/Disable stay inside the box)
- Per-row icon actions with tooltips; Save button lights up only on changes
- Per-row QR modal; Details modal close fixed and reliable
- Auto-refresh after creating a link; new row is highlighted and scrolled into view
- Expiry save fix: stores end-of-day to avoid off-by-one date issues

Roadmap highlight
- We’d like to add a per-user UI and remove reliance on a fixed API key by allowing users to authenticate and provide their own Immich API tokens. This is not in scope for the initial versions but aligns with future direction.
- The frontend automatically switches to chunked mode only for files larger than the configured chunk size.

### 📱 Device‑Flexible HMI (New)
- Fully responsive UI with improved spacing and wrapping for small and large screens.
- Mobile‑safe file picker and a sticky bottom “Choose files” bar on phones.
- Safe‑area padding for devices with notches; refined dark/light theme behavior.
- Desktop keeps the dropzone clickable; touch devices avoid accidental double‑open.

### ♻️ Reliability & Quality of Life (New)
- Retry button to re‑attempt any failed upload without re‑selecting the file.
- Progress and status updates are more resilient to late/reordered WebSocket events.
- Invites can be created without an album, keeping uploads unassigned when preferred.

### Last 8 Days – Highlights
- Added chunked uploads with configurable chunk size.
- Added optional passwords for invite links with in‑UI unlock prompt.
- Responsive HMI overhaul: mobile‑safe picker, sticky mobile action bar, safe‑area support.
- Retry for failed uploads and improved progress handling.
- Support for invites with no album association.

### 🌙 Dark Mode
- Automatic or manual toggle; persisted preference

### 📁 Album Integration
- Auto-create + assign album if configured; optional invites without album

---

## Chunked Uploads

- Enable chunked uploads by setting `CHUNKED_UPLOADS_ENABLED=true`.
- Configure chunk size with `CHUNK_SIZE_MB` (default: `95`). The client only uses chunked mode for files larger than this.
- Intended to bypass upstream limits (e.g., 100MB) while preserving duplicate checks, EXIF timestamps, album add, and per‑item progress via WebSocket.

---

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** static HTML/JS (Tailwind). Drag & drop or "Choose files", queue UI with progress and status chips.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Uvicorn.  
  - Proxies uploads to Immich `/assets`  
  - Computes SHA‑1 and checks a local SQLite cache (`state.db`)  
  - Optional Immich de‑dupe via `/assets/bulk-upload-check`  
  - WebSocket `/ws` pushes per‑item progress to the current browser session only  
- **Persistence:** local SQLite (`state.db`) prevents re‑uploads across sessions/runs.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.11
- An **Immich** server + **API key**

---
# Local dev quickstart

## Development

Run with live reload:

```bash
python main.py
```

The backend contains docstrings so you can generate docs later if desired.

---

## Dev Configuration (.env)

```ini
# Server (dev only)
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8080

# Immich connection (include /api)
IMMICH_BASE_URL=http://REPLACE_ME:2283/api
IMMICH_API_KEY=ADD-YOUR-API-KEY   # needs: asset.upload; for albums also: album.create, album.read, albumAsset.create
MAX_CONCURRENT=3

# Public uploader page (optional) — disabled by default
PUBLIC_UPLOAD_PAGE_ENABLED=TRUE

# Album (optional): auto-add uploads from public uploader to this album (creates if needed)
IMMICH_ALBUM_NAME=dead-drop

# Local dedupe cache (SQLite)
STATE_DB=./data/state.db

# Base URL for generating absolute invite links (recommended for production)
# e.g., PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://photos.example.com
#PUBLIC_BASE_URL=

# Session and security
SESSION_SECRET=SET-A-STRONG-RANDOM-VALUE
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Chunked uploads (optional)
CHUNKED_UPLOADS_ENABLED=true
CHUNK_SIZE_MB=95

```


You can keep a checked‑in `/.env.example` with the keys above for onboarding.

## How it works

1. **Queue** – Files selected in the browser are queued; each gets a client‑side ID.  
2. **De‑dupe (local)** – Server computes **SHA‑1** and checks `state.db`. If seen, marks as **duplicate**.  
3. **De‑dupe (server)** – Attempts Immich `/assets/bulk-upload-check`; if Immich reports duplicate, marks accordingly.  
4. **Upload** – Multipart POST to `${IMMICH_BASE_URL}/assets` with:
   - `assetData`, `deviceAssetId`, `deviceId`,  
   - `fileCreatedAt`, `fileModifiedAt` (from EXIF when available; else `lastModified`),  
   - `isFavorite=false`, `filename`, and header `x-immich-checksum`.  
5. **Album** – If `IMMICH_ALBUM_NAME` is configured, adds the uploaded asset to the album (creates album if it doesn't exist).  
6. **Progress** – Backend streams progress via WebSocket to the same session.  
7. **Privacy** – UI shows only the current session's items. It never lists server media.

---

## Security notes

- The menu and invite creation are behind login. Logout clears the session.  
- Invite links are public by URL; share only with intended recipients.  
- The default uploader page at `/` is disabled unless `PUBLIC_UPLOAD_PAGE_ENABLED=true`.  
- The Immich API key remains **server‑side**; the browser never sees it.  
- No browsing of uploaded media; only ephemeral session state is shown.  
- Run behind HTTPS with a reverse proxy and restrict CORS to your domain(s).

## Usage flow

- Admin: Login → Menu → Create invite link (optionally one‑time / expiry / album) → Share link or QR.  
- Guest: Open invite link → Drop files → Upload progress and results shown.  
- Optional: Enable public uploader and set `IMMICH_ALBUM_NAME` for a default landing page.
